                  The amount of time, in seconds, until a new instance is considered to have
                  finished initializing and resource consumption to become stable after it
                  enters the InService state.

                  During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the warm-up
                  period after it replaces an instance before it moves on to replacing the
                  next instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also waits for the warm-up period
                  before aggregating the metrics for new instances with existing instances
                  in the Amazon CloudWatch metrics that are used for scaling, resulting in
                  more reliable usage data. For more information, see Set the default instance
                  warmup for an Auto Scaling group (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html)
                  in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

                  To manage various warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that
                  you set the default instance warmup, even if it is set to 0 seconds. To remove
                  a value that you previously set, include the property but specify -1 for
                  the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the default instance warmup
                  enabled by specifying a value of 0 or other nominal value.

                  scale beyond this capacity if you configure auto scaling. This number must
                  be greater than or equal to the minimum size of the group and less than or
                  equal to the maximum size of the group. If you do not specify a desired capacity,

                  and marking it unhealthy due to a failed health check. This is useful if

                            Use this structure to let Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling do the following when the
                            Auto Scaling group has a mixed instances policy:

                              - Override the instance type that is specified in the launch template.

                              - Use multiple instance types.

                            Specify the instance types that you want, or define your instance requirements
                            instead and let Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provision the available instance
                            types that meet your requirements. This can provide Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                            with a larger selection of instance types to choose from when fulfilling
                            Spot and On-Demand capacities. You can view which instance types are matched
                            before you apply the instance requirements to your Auto Scaling group.

                            After you define your instance requirements, you don't have to keep updating
                            these settings to get new EC2 instance types automatically. Amazon EC2 Auto
                            Scaling uses the instance requirements of the Auto Scaling group to determine
                            whether a new EC2 instance type can be used.

                                The attributes for the instance types for a mixed instances policy. Amazon
                                EC2 Auto Scaling uses your specified requirements to identify instance types.
                                Then, it uses your On-Demand and Spot allocation strategies to launch instances
                                from these instance types.

                                When you specify multiple attributes, you get instance types that satisfy
                                all of the specified attributes. If you specify multiple values for an attribute,
                                you get instance types that satisfy any of the specified values.

                                To limit the list of instance types from which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can
                                identify matching instance types, you can use one of the following parameters,
                                but not both in the same request:

                                   * AllowedInstanceTypes - The instance types to include in the list. All
                                   other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes.

                                   * ExcludedInstanceTypes - The instance types to exclude from the list,
                                   even if they match your specified attributes.

                                You must specify VCpuCount and MemoryMiB. All other attributes are optional.
                                Any unspecified optional attribute is set to its default.

                                    Setting the minimum bandwidth does not guarantee that your instance will
                                    achieve the minimum bandwidth. Amazon EC2 will identify instance types that
                                    support the specified minimum bandwidth, but the actual bandwidth of your
                                    instance might go below the specified minimum at times. For more information,
